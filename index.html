    <h1>Hi Ijel!</h1> 
    <p>Happy birthday! Today is the day to celebrate your extraordinary existence. If life were a movie, you are one of the best part of it.
<br><br>
Between seas, galaxies, and moons, I was lucky I stepped on the planet, I dreamed under the same stars as you.
<br><br>
We've traversed oceans of memories, ventured through galaxies of experiences, and basked beneath the beauty of moons together. I feel gladly to be able admire your beauty. You were a sky, between the ground and the sun.
<br><br>
You are doing such a great job. I can't describe how much my thanks for you to be born and survive until your twenty five, i really proud of you, Ijel.
<br><br>
May this year be a chapter filled with colors, joy, and happiness. Thank you for being a part of my life's story. Happy birthday, and may each of your days be filled with colors and the day always shine! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚</p>
